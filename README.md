Stripped down version of tw+

# tw_plus
Modification of tw+ server by teetime, for the game Teeworlds.
It includes dm, tdm and ctf gamemodes and the grenade and laser instagib modes for them, as well as the iFreeze gamemode.
tw+ server by Teetime can be found here: https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/tw-plus
This modification adds new gametypes (Hold The Flag (HTF), LMS, no-items DM), map-based features, some ddnetclient support, and some other miscellaneous silly and useful additions.

## How to build (Cmake)
The server can be built using CMake:
<code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make</code>

## Features
Apart from the features of the standard server as well as the tw+ server by teetime, the server include the following:
Note that the folder ./client-files contains some data that may be useful when making maps for this mod. You may want to see the wiki for examples on how to add teleports and boost/jump pads.

teleports (player, flag, and projectiles, (todo: laser?))
grenade fountains
slow killing death / slow healing / slow armor zone
No-flag zone
boost zone, boost-pad
custom weapon spawns

**Weapons**
ninja (toggle invincibility, crazy-weapons, slash speed, heart/armor bonusses on pickup)
toggleable silly custom weapons (laser->plasmagun, grenade->(wip)bouncy grenade, shotgun->explosive shotgun; repeater)
pistol autoshooting
indirect killing by hooking tee into spikes
